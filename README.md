# Mongolian

欢迎使用 Mongolian Gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/mongolian`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## 安装

安装 Gem 并添加到应用的 Gemfile 可以通过执行：

```bash
bundle add mongolian
```

如果没有使用 bundler 管理依赖，可以通过：

```bash
gem install mongolian
```
直接安装。

## 用法

1. 判断一个字符或者词是否包含蒙古文字符；
2. 蒙古文分词；
3. 蒙古文词干提取；

## 开发

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
